I followed this guide to get the proxmox host to share the K1 as a PCI passthrough device: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/b5xpua/the_ultimate_beginners_guide_to_gpu_passthrough/

On the VM things are very tricky.

if you are just using a Windows VM, you can probably use something like Sunshine and run rudimentary games using an old driver. Windows will probably work OK.

A linux VMis harder. I'm using Ubuntu Server. For the GRID K1 you cannot use the standard Debian drivers, they are too new. You need 367 or older.

367 does not work with modern kernels, you need to patch the drivers. I could only find a patch for 340, so I'm using that. Instructions here: https://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2020/inttf-nvidia-patcher/
It's possible that this could also work: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/uidipv/how_to_install_nvidia_driver_340_on_ubuntu_2204/

On the client VM you also want to disable `nouveau` like so:
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.confecho "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

Now with an older nvidia driver version, modern CUDA won't work, so a recently compiled ffmpeg won't work.

I'm trying to use this GRID for transcoding so I'm compiling an old version of ffpmeg (3.4.8 was too old, trying something older) and building that with cuda support.

The goal is to use this with Jellyfin

Edit: I'm trying ffmpeg 2.6 which should support the older nvenc headers for my driver version, but I can't find the dang headers for nvenc. I think I need nvenc headers for version 4 or 5. Only versions 8 and above seem to be available in the wild.
